# Rust Planning

Personal project for motion planning and search algorithm implementations using Rust.

Currently has rough cut versions of both `RRT` and `RRT*`.
For now refer to the integration [tests](tests/rrt_test.rs) for sample usage.

A more comprehensive example using the `geometry` crate is in progress.
